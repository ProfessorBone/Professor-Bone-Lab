📚 Books — Applied Study & Systems Translation

This folder contains active, hands-on study work derived from books related to agentic AI, system design, reasoning architectures, and applied intelligence.

These are not passive reading notes.

Each book studied here is treated as a design artifact to be:
	•	interrogated,
	•	stress-tested,
	•	translated into modern agent architectures,
	•	and upgraded to production-grade patterns.

🎯 Purpose of This Folder

The goal of this folder is to bridge the gap between:

Conceptual frameworks in books
and
Implementable agent systems in 2025

For every book we study, we aim to extract:
	•	reusable mental models,
	•	concrete architectural patterns,
	•	explicit state and control flow designs,
	•	and working code experiments.

This material may later evolve into:
	•	an Agentic Build Guide
	•	teaching labs
	•	public notebooks
	•	or structured curriculum content

🧠 How Books Are Studied Here

Each book is analyzed using a systems-first lens:

For Every Major Section, We Ask:
	•	What kind of agent is being described?
	•	Is this:
	•	a true agent,
	•	a workflow with an LLM,
	•	or a multi-agent system?
	•	Where does state live?
	•	What is transient vs persistent memory?
	•	What architectural layer does this belong to?
	•	Data
	•	Knowledge
	•	Agent Logic
	•	Orchestration
	•	Execution

🧪 Notebooks = Living Experiments

Jupyter Notebooks in each book folder are not demos.

They are:
	•	architectural sandboxes,
	•	controlled experiments,
	•	translation layers from theory → implementation.

Common notebook themes include:
	•	explicit state schema design
	•	LangGraph-style node/edge modeling
	•	planner vs executor separation
	•	failure handling and retries
	•	evaluation loops and observability

If an idea cannot be implemented cleanly, that fact is documented.

🚫 What This Folder Is Not
	•	❌ Chapter summaries
	•	❌ Book reports
	•	❌ Marketing-driven frameworks
	•	❌ Blind acceptance of terminology

Every framework must earn its place by surviving:
	•	architectural scrutiny
	•	failure analysis
	•	and modern system constraints

🔁 Cumulative & Cross-Referenced

Concepts may:
	•	reappear across multiple books,
	•	be refined over time,
	•	or be explicitly rejected.

When the same idea shows up under different names:
	•	we call it out,
	•	unify it,
	•	or deprecate it.

🧭 Guiding Principle

If it can't be expressed as state, control flow, and execution boundaries — it isn't an architecture.

This folder exists to make that boundary explicit.
