    "# Section 1: Why State and Reasoning Must Be Separate (But Connected)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the fundamental principle: **separation of concerns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 State and Reasoning Are Distinct Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is State?\n",
    "\n",
    "**State** is the **data** that an agent knows and remembers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "STATE = Data at rest\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "• User query: \"Find papers on transformers\"\n",
    "• Retrieved documents: [doc1, doc2, doc3]\n",
    "• Selected papers: [paper_a, paper_b]\n",
    "• Current step: 3\n",
    "• Is complete: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "State is:\n",
    "- **Persistent**: Survives across reasoning steps\n",
    "- **Structured**: Typed fields with clear schemas\n",
    "- **Observable**: Can be inspected at any point\n",
    "- **Serializable**: Can be saved, loaded, replayed\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is Reasoning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning** is the **process** by which an agent decides what to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "REASONING = Logic in motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "• \"I have the query, I should search for papers\"\n",
    "• \"I found 10 papers, I should filter to top 3\"\n",
    "• \"I have 3 papers, I can now synthesize\"\n",
    "• \"My synthesis is complete, I should terminate\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning is:\n",
    "- **Procedural**: A sequence of thoughts and decisions\n",
    "- **Contextual**: Depends on current state\n",
    "- **Transient** (if not recorded): Happens during execution\n",
    "- **Actionable**: Produces state changes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Why They Must Be Separate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle: Separation of Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "STATE:      \"What do I know?\"\n",
    "REASONING:  \"What should I do with what I know?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are fundamentally different questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Separation Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | If Mixed | If Separated |\n",
    "|--------|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Debugging** | Can't tell data from logic | Clear boundaries |\n",
    "| **Testing** | Hard to test reasoning in isolation | Can unit test each |\n",
    "| **Reusability** | Logic tied to specific state shape | Reasoning portable |\n",
    "| **Validation** | Can't validate data vs decisions separately | Independent validation |\n",
    "| **Observability** | Black box behavior | Transparent process |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: The Wrong Way (Mixed)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# BAD: Reasoning hidden in prompt\n",
    "prompt = f\"\"\"\n",
    "You are an agent. Your task is to find papers on {query}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think step by step:\n",
    "1. Search for papers\n",
    "2. Filter by relevance\n",
    "3. Summarize findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Now do it.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "response = llm.generate(prompt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems:**\n",
    "- State (query) is buried in prompt string\n",
    "- Reasoning (steps 1-3) is in prompt, not in state\n",
    "- No way to verify steps actually happened\n",
    "- Response is opaque text, not structured state\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: The Right Way (Separated)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# GOOD: Clear separation\n",
    "state = {\n",
    "    \"query\": \"Find papers on transformers\",  # Data\n",
    "    \"papers\": [],\n",
    "    \"current_step\": 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reasoning reads state, decides action\n",
    "if state[\"current_step\"] == 1:\n",
    "    thought = \"I should search for papers\"\n",
    "    action = search_papers(state[\"query\"])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Reasoning writes results back to state\n",
    "    state[\"papers\"] = action.results\n",
    "    state[\"reasoning_trace\"].append({\"thought\": thought, \"action\": \"search\"})\n",
    "    state[\"current_step\"] = 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- State is structured data\n",
    "- Reasoning is explicit code\n",
    "- Can verify each step\n",
    "- Can inspect state at any point\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Why Reasoning Should NOT Live Inside Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting reasoning in prompts is one of the most common anti-patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Prompt-Based \"Reasoning\" Trap\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prompt: \"Think step by step and solve this problem\"\n",
    "         ↓\n",
    "    [LLM generates text that LOOKS like reasoning]\n",
    "         ↓\n",
    "    But it's just text, not actual steps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Wrong With This?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Problem | Why It Fails |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **No verification** | Can't check if steps actually executed |\n",
    "| **No branching** | Can't take different paths based on intermediate results |\n",
    "| **No tool use** | Can't call real tools between steps |\n",
    "| **No state update** | No persistent memory of what happened |\n",
    "| **Hallucination risk** | LLM can claim to have done things it didn't |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Correct Approach: Externalized Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Reasoning as CODE, not PROMPTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read current state\n",
    "2. Decide what to do (reasoning logic)\n",
    "3. Execute action (tool call, API, etc.)\n",
    "4. Record decision in state\n",
    "5. Write results to state\n",
    "6. Repeat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now reasoning is:\n",
    "- ✅ Verifiable (in code)\n",
    "- ✅ Traceable (recorded in state)\n",
    "- ✅ Testable (unit tests)\n",
    "- ✅ Observable (state inspection)\n",

    "## 1.4 Why State Without Reasoning Is Inert\n",
    "\n",
    "State alone cannot do anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State = Passive Data\n",
    "\n",

    "- Decide what to do next\n",
    "- Execute actions\n",
    "- Update itself\n",
    "- Reach conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasoning = Active Logic\n",

    "\n",

    "# Reasoning looks at state and decides\n",
    "if not state[\"papers\"]:\n",
    "    # \"I need to search!\"\n",

    "    state[\"papers\"] = papers\n",
    "    state[\"current_step\"] = 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Without reasoning:\n",
    "- State never changes\n",
    "- No progress toward goal\n",
    "- Agent is frozen\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Why Reasoning Without State Is Brittle\n",

    "    # I can't! No state was saved.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems:**\n",
    "- Each step starts from scratch\n",
    "- Can't build on previous work\n",
    "- Must re-retrieve data every time\n",
    "- No way to trace history\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasoning WITH State = Memory\n",
    "\n",

    "### Phase 1: READ from State\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens:**\n",
    "- Agent examines current state\n",
    "- Retrieves relevant data fields\n",
    "- Understands current context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Read:\n",
    "• What is my goal? → \"Find papers on transformers\"\n",
    "• What have I done so far? → \"Nothing yet, step 1\"\n",
    "• What data do I have? → \"No papers retrieved yet\"\n",

    "**What happens:**\n",
    "- Agent analyzes what it read\n",
    "- Decides on next action\n",

    "• \"Therefore, I should search the database\"\n",
    "• Decision: Execute search action\n",

    "## 6.7 Key Insights: RAG State-Reasoning Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We Learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reasoning controls the flow**: The agent decides when to retrieve, select, and synthesize\n",
    "2. **State stores reasoning decisions**: Every decision is recorded in `reasoning_trace`\n",
    "3. **Validation ensures correctness**: We can verify that retrieval happens before synthesis\n",
    "4. **Reasoning references state**: Synthesis uses `selected_documents` from state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Pattern:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "READ state → REASON about phase → EXECUTE action → WRITE results → UPDATE phase\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Transparent**: We can see exactly what the agent decided at each step\n",
    "- ✅ **Verifiable**: We can validate the sequence is correct\n",
    "- ✅ **Debuggable**: We can trace exactly where problems occur\n",
    "- ✅ **Grounded**: Every decision is based on actual state, not assumptions\n",

    "> **Agents are state machines where reasoning transforms state through explicit Read → Reason → Write loops. By keeping state and reasoning separate, respecting field boundaries, and validating transitions, you build agents that are transparent, debuggable, and production-ready.**\n",
