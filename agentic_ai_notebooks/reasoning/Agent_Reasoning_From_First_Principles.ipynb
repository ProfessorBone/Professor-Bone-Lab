    "### The Problem with Internal Reasoning\n",

    "# ↓\n",
    "response = \"Based on recent papers, transformers use attention...\"\n",

    "**Problems:**\n",
    "1. ❌ Did the agent actually search? **Unknown.**\n",
    "2. ❌ Which papers did it find? **Unknown.**\n",
    "3. ❌ Why did it choose those papers? **Unknown.**\n",
    "4. ❌ Can we verify the summary? **No.**\n",

    "| Inside a Prompt | Between Steps |\n",
    "|-----------------|---------------|\n",
    "| \"Think about X, then Y, then Z\" | Step 1: Think → Act → Observe<br>Step 2: Think → Act → Observe |\n",

    "| Cannot adapt mid-reasoning | Can adapt based on observations |\n",
    "| No real-world feedback | Real-world feedback after each action |\n",
    "| Hallucination risk high | Grounded in actual observations |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Why Between-Steps Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach 1: Inside Prompt (Bad)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prompt: \"\"\"\n",
    "Search for papers on transformers, \n",
    "then filter for the top 3, \n",
    "then summarize them.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "\"I found papers A, B, C. \n",
    "The top 3 are A, B, C.\n",
    "Summary: ...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: The LLM didn't actually search. It hallucinated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach 2: Between Steps (Good)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Step 1:\n",
    "  Thought: \"I should search\"\n",
    "  Action: search(\"transformers\")\n",
    "  Observation: [actual search results]\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2:\n",
    "  Thought: \"I got 10 papers, I should filter\"\n",
    "  Action: filter_by_citations(top=3)\n",
    "  Observation: [3 specific papers]\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3:\n",
    "  Thought: \"Now I can summarize these specific papers\"\n",
    "  Action: summarize([papers])\n",
    "  Observation: [actual summary based on real papers]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works**:\n",

    "## 🎯 Final Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Agent reasoning is the structured, externalized, evidence-based, iterative process by which agents decide what to do. It must be stored in state, validated rigorously, and designed with production scaling in mind. Reasoning is not what you prompt the LLM to do—it's the infrastructure you build around the LLM.**\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Practice:** Implement a simple agent using the patterns in this notebook\n",
    "2. **Validate:** Use the checklist to review your reasoning design\n",
    "3. **Scale:** Apply the production guidance when deploying\n",
    "4. **Iterate:** Monitor reasoning metrics and improve\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Good reasoning design is what separates demos from production systems.\n",
