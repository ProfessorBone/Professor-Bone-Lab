# Professor Bone Lab

Professor Bone Lab is a public, first-principles AI systems laboratory focused on understanding **how intelligent systems actually work** — not just how to prompt them.

This lab explores:
- Explicit agent state
- Reasoning as a state transformation
- Evaluation-aware architectures
- Orchestration and multi-agent systems

The emphasis is clarity, structure, and architectural integrity.

## 🧠 Lab Philosophy

Modern AI systems fail not because models are weak, but because **state, reasoning, and evaluation are implicit or poorly defined**.

This lab treats those concepts as first-class architectural components.

No hype.  
No framework worship.  
Just understanding.

## 📓 Sections

### 🔹 Agentic AI Notebooks
Hands-on, executable notebooks exploring concepts from first principles.

Path:
- Agent State
- Reasoning
- State ↔ Reasoning Interaction
- Multi-Agent Capstone

---

### 🔹 Agentic AI Notes
Written explanations, distilled insights, and architectural reasoning that support the notebooks.

---

### 🔹 Diagrams
Visual models of state, reasoning flows, and multi-agent coordination.

---

### 🔹 Books
Deep study and systems translation of foundational books on agentic AI. Each book is treated as a design substrate to be interrogated, stress-tested, and translated into modern agent architectures.

---

### 🔹 Essays/Papers
Original technical writing, architectural analysis, and research documentation exploring agent systems, reasoning patterns, and design principles.

---

### 🔹 References
Curated papers and source material grounding the work.

## 🎯 Intended Audience

- AI engineers
- Systems thinkers
- Researchers
- Practitioners building agentic systems
- Learners who care about *why* things work

## 🚧 Status

This lab is actively evolving.  
Artifacts are added as understanding deepens.
